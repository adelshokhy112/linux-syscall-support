= How to get an LSS change committed =

== Review ==

You get your change reviewed, you can upload it to http://codereview.chromium.org (Rietveld) using `git cl upload` from Chromium's `depot-tools`.

== Testing ==

Unfortunately, LSS has no automated test suite.

You can test LSS by patching it into Chromium, building Chromium, and running Chromium's tests.  (See ProjectsUsingLSS.)

You can compile-test LSS by running:
{{{
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wstrict-prototypes -c linux_syscall_support.h
}}}

== Rolling into Chromium ==

If you commit a change to LSS, please also commit a Chromium change to update `lss_revision` in Chromium's DEPS file.

This ensures that the LSS change gets tested, so that people who commit later LSS changes don't run into problems with updating `lss_revision`.
